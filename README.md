To test the demo, please download all three folders in this repository. `data` folder contains neuron XYZ coordinates as `.RDS` file and three basic grid files saved as `.csv` for vector field decompostion in MATLAB. `script` folder contains necessary R scripts for vector field smoothing and the L2-norm calculation. Note also the `output` folder (though empty) is needed for storing the generated vector fields.
